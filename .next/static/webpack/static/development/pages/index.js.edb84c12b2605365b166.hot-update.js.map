To run one, start by looking at the first integer. Here, you will find an opcode - either 1, 2, or 99.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The opcode indicates what to do:\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          99: the program is finished and should immediately halt\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          1: add together numbers read from two positions and stores the result in a third position. The three integers immediately after the opcode tell you these three positions - the first two indicate the positions from which you should read the input values, and the third indicates the position at which the output should be stored.\n            For example, if your Intcode computer encounters 1,10,20,30, it should read the values at positions 10 and 20, add those values, and then overwrite the value at position 30 with their sum.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          2: works exactly like opcode 1, except it multiplies the two inputs instead of adding them.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Once you're done processing an opcode, move to the next one by stepping forward 4 positions.\n        </p>\n        <h2 className=\"h1\">Part I:</h2>\n        <p>\n          Run your computer on the given input to find what the final answer is (answer will be stored at position 0)\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <code>\n            [ // input goes here ]\n          </code>\n        </p>\n        <h2 className=\"h1\">Part II:</h2>\n        <p>\n          Assuming index 1 and 2 in the provided array are inputs.
